   cd lab_03
   ```

3. Compile the program using the `make` command:

   ```shell
   make
   ```

4. Run the program:

   ```shell
   ./matrix_generator
   ```

## Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Run the program by executing the following command:

   ```shell
   ./matrix_generator
   ```

2. Enter the desired size for the matrix. The size must be within the range [4; 20] and even.

3. The program will generate and display the matrix.

## Example

Here is an example output of the program with a matrix size of 5:

```shell
Matrix size (it must be in range [4; 20] and even): 5

Generated Matrix:
17	16	15	14	13	
18	5	4	3	12	
19	6	1	2	11	
20	7	8	9	10	
21	22	23	24	25	
```
